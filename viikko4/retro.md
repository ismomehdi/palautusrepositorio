- Start doing
- Stop doing
- Continue doing
- Do more
- Do less 

It's kind of a checklist that helps teams improve by identifying specific actions in each category.

## Glad, Sad, Mad: 

Team members share what made them:
- Glad
- Sad
- or mad 
during a project or a sprint. 

It's a way to express feelings and understand the emotional impact of the work. This encourages open communication in teams.

Both methods are used in retrospectives, which are meetings to reflect on past work, to improve team dynamics and project outcomes.
